# The *Learning Web Design* Tutorials

This repository is where you will do your homework from the *Learning Web Design* textbook. Follow the instructions given in the book except as directed below.

* **Do not edit anything inside the `LWD4e_materials` folder**, which is downloaded from the Author's website for your convenience. You may need to copy some files from there, however. Just don't copy the solutions; that would be cheating!
* **Ignore any software suggestions in the book.** We are using Atom, GitHub, and Chrome/Firefox for everything.
* **Do not create any redundant copies of any files or folders.** If there are multiple revisions or versions of a file, then use Git to track them. You can have as many version of a files as you like with Git. So, don't create a `Chapter 4` folder for the `bistro` project; just use the `bistro` folder instead. When you return to the `bistro` project in later chapters, just go back to the project folder and `commit` your new work as a new version.
* **Commit your work (i.e., add a new version) at the end of each exercise**. Don't wait until the end of the chapter. It's better to commit early and often, before you mess something up. Each `commit` should always have a meaningful *commit comment* that indicates what work was performed. In this case, indicate what exercise was completed: "Completed exercise 6-2" is much better than "Entered some HTML. Yay!"
* **Push your local repository to GitHub at the end of each chapter.** This will give you a backup in case your computer crashes. Don't laugh, that has happened to at leas one student every semester we have offered this course. It will also give your instructor a way to see your work and provide help if you get stuck.

*I have read and understand the above instructions.*
